### 1. GitHub Security Advisory (Recommended)
You can report vulnerabilities directly through the **Security** tab of this repository on GitHub. This allows us to discuss and fix the issue in a private, secure environment before disclosure.

### 2. Email
Alternatively, you can contact the maintainer directly at:
[sadman30102001sakib@gmail.com](mailto:sadman30102001sakib@gmail.com)

## Our Process
1. **Acknowledge**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigate**: We will investigate the issue and determine its impact.
3. **Fix**: We will work on a fix and release a new version (e.g., v3.1.4).
4. **Disclose**: Once the fix is verified and released, we will publish a security advisory to inform the community.

Thank you for helping keep Circuit Playground Pro safe! 🛡️
